# Prompt Engineering For Development

Using Prompt Engineering to create a project.

## Prompt for Initial Project

```Prompt
You are an expert prompt engineer with access to a private LLM that has capabilities equivalent to GPT-4. Imagine you are tasked with designing an initial project for a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. This Python application will extract data from a designated website, transform the data into vector embeddings, and store these embeddings in a Chroma vector database. The application will then use these stored vectors to answer users' questions. The project leverages LangChain for its workflow orchestration, utilizes the 'nomic-embed-text' model for creating embeddings, connects to an Ollama-hosted LLM server, and uses the 'llama3.3' model for generating responses. Please create a detailed prompt that outlines the project's requirements and initial design considerations.
